In this taks, you should implement the quadratic formula. 
`(-b +- (b^2 - 4ac)^(1/2))/2a`

Implement it in a function `calculateX`, that should return the possible x values. 
The function should return a tuple with two values.

Please make sure that your solution is self-contained within the `calculateX` function. In other words, only change the body of the function, not the code outside the function.
